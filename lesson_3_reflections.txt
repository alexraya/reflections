When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository allows for work to be easily shared with others and collaborated on, and also be backed up in the cloud for backup storage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually rather than automatically allows for checking to be done on changes prior to uploading for any content that may want to be kept from public view.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of a GitHub repository from one person's accounts to another. A clone is a copy of a branch. A branch is a lineage of changes within a repository. A fork is useful way to copy a whole repository, while cloning a branch is helpful for creating new code within an existing repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally allows for work to be done from the latest clean, up-to-date branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Collaborating without using Git or GitHub would be difficult, as any code changes would not be able to be shared in detail. There are other automated version control platforms, but do not perform the complex management that is possible with Git or GitHub.
