When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository allows for work to be easily shared with others and collaborated on, and also be backed up in the cloud for backup storage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually rather than automatically allows for checking to be done on changes prior to uploading for any content that may want to be kept from public view.
